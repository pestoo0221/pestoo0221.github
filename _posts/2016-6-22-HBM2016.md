title: Machine Learning Approach to Find Brain Structural & Functional pattern Distinguishing Motor Disability in People with Multiple Sclerosis    
---

### Background

Previous functional MRI (fMRI) studies involving dominant hand motor tasks suggest  functional reorganization occurs in the brains of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout the disease course, potentially explaining the low correlation between structural degeneration and disability [1-4]. However, the relationship between resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) reorganization in the sensorimotor network and motor disability in MS is not clear yet. Such information would improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor impairment and may guide future treatments to preserve functional ability. 

### Aim
This study investigated changes in rsFC of the left hemisphere hand motor (LM1) region between MS participants with and without right hand dysfunction, compared to healthy controls (HC). Structural abnormalities of grey matter volume and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) values measured at the global level and within regions with rsFC abnormalities in people with MS, were also investigated.

### Data Collection
* Right-handed participants underwent T1-weighted MRI, magnetization transfer (MT) images and resting-state functional MRI with their eyes closed. 
* The 9-hole peg test (9HPT) was performed as a measure of hand motor performance outside of the scanner. 
* MS participants were considered as motor preserved (MP) if they scored within two standard deviations (SDs) of published norms [5] with the right hand on the 9HPT and as motor impaired (MI) if they scored two SDs or more. 
* 26 MP, 17 MI, and 20 HCs (age and sex matched) 

### Statistical Analyses
* Seed-based correlation [6] for each subject, with the LM1 used as the seed
* One-way ANCOVA analysis to examine within-group and between-group (MP, MI, HC) comparisons of FC, with age, sex and normalized volume of whole brain grey matter controlled for 
* Normalized volume and MTR values within ROIs calculated and compared between groups
* Logistic regression analysis

### Results & Conlcusion

* Compared to the HC group, the MP group shows a more widespread functional network of the LM1, the MI group shows a more limited functional network of the LM1
* Brain structures, FC of the LM1 and clinical manifestations of MS are linked together
* In structurally intact regions (with normal grey matter volume and MTR values) outside of the traditional motor network, stronger FC of the LM1 may mitigate motor impairment in MS
* Within regions of the traditional motor network that have lower grey matter volume, weaker FC of the LM1 may contribute to worse hand motor impairment in MS
