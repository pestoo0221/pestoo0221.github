I obtained my bachelor’s degree in BioMedical Engineering in Xi’an Jiaotong University in China, and PhD in Computational Neuroscience in National University of Singapore. I’m currently working as a post-doc fellow in department of Neurosurgery in University of Toronto/Krembil Research Institute with Dr. Mojgan Hodaie, in collaboration with The Centre for Image-Guided Innovation and Therapeutic Intervention in Sickkids.
